### candy loyalty

At King Games, known for its hit title Candy Crush, I had the unique opportunity to spearhead the launch of the company's inaugural loyalty program, an ambitious project aimed at enhancing player engagement and retention. My role involved directing the technical launch of the loyalty site, where I led an international team that encompassed expertise from various domains including Candy Crush operations, loyalty programs, UX/UI design, product management, and engineering. Our collective efforts culminated in the introduction of a comprehensive suite of features such as a bonus system, a digital storefront, exclusive content offerings, and advanced dashboarding capabilities. This multifaceted approach was designed to create a rewarding and engaging player experience, significantly elevating user interaction with the game.

The launch of the loyalty program was a resounding success, surpassing initial pilot projections substantially. Through strategic marketing initiatives and continuous enhancements to the program, we achieved remarkable results including $400K in monthly bookings, which represented a 10% increase. Furthermore, the program attracted 70K unique visitors, with a notable 25% return rate, and facilitated 63K reward redemptions, marking a 20% conversion rate. These metrics not only underscored the program's effectiveness but also highlighted its potential to drive significant financial and engagement gains.

To sustain and build upon this success, I developed a detailed program dashboard that allowed for meticulous monitoring of participant KPIs and program OKRs. This tool was pivotal in guiding adaptive roadmap strategies, which led to a consistent 10% month-over-month increase in key engagement metrics such as Net Promoter Score (NPS), site visits, and time spent on site. This strategic approach ensured that we remained agile, responsive to player feedback, and ahead of market trends, thereby cementing the loyalty program's role as a cornerstone of King Games' player engagement strategy.
