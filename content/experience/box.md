### Revamping Infrastructure: Pioneering Box.com's Hardware Engineering Revolution

Facing significant challenges with decentralized hardware design and procurement processes, such as inconsistency, increased costs, and supply chain complications, my role at Box.com as a Hardware Engineering TPM was pivotal in transforming our infrastructure to support expansive cloud storage services. I led the strategic centralization of hardware operations, unifying over 30 hardware configurations across 50 platforms, which enhanced system reliability and scalability, preparing Box for future growth.

This overhaul not only improved operational visibility and efficiency but also enabled us to leverage economies of scale, reducing costs and simplifying vendor negotiations. Further, I reengineered Box’s storage solutions, achieving a breakthrough that doubled our performance and reduced ownership costs by 25%, saving $2 million. This not only demonstrated our efficiency commitment but also positioned Box as a leader in high-performance, cost-effective cloud storage.

Additionally, I enhanced our decision-making processes, increasing solution evaluation speed by 25% by tripling hardware evaluation capacity and delegating detailed testing to partners. This streamlined hardware deployment and fostered stronger collaborations, ensuring rapid and high-quality rollouts.

These initiatives significantly boosted Box’s operational efficiencies and reinforced its position as a robust, scalable cloud storage solution, mirroring continuous improvement and innovative leadership.
