    My background is diverse, as a specialized generalist. In technology I have a wide range of experiences: from backend to mobile development or infrastructure, as well as individual contributor or leading teams. I apply the 3P's (People, Product, Process) to my work, and I am passionate about contributing to healthy teams that work in iterative improvements.
