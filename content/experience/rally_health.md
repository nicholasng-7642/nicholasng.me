### Transforming Healthcare at Rally Health: Leading Through Innovation and Resilience

At Rally Health, my journey was marked by a series of transformative challenges, each designed to elevate our healthcare solutions to new heights. As I embarked on these endeavors, the complexity of our systems and the scale of our ambitions pushed me to innovate and adapt relentlessly.

Medicare Fitness Program:
Leading the charge on the Medicare Fitness program, I was thrust into the vortex of healthcare innovation. Tasked with launching the UHC Medicare fitness program, my first major initiative not only generated an astounding $215M in first-year enrollment revenue but also positioned it among the top ten initiatives within the company. This success was not just a numberâ€”it was a testament to our ability to connect with and impact the lives of our members. Our team, a vibrant tapestry of over 15 cross-functional groups, melded Agile and traditional methodologies to exceed our goals, enhancing feature delivery and user engagement. As the digital world adapted to a pandemic, our team swiftly pivoted to create a media portal, providing over 12,000 virtual and streaming classes to keep our community strong and connected, bringing utilization from a standstill back to a lively 20%.

Developer Advocacy Program:
In the realm of developer tooling, my role evolved as I advocated for a more seamless and efficient engineering environment. By consolidating disparate engineering activities into five unified DevOps programs, we saved the organization $1M annually. However, the real victory was in enhancing our collaborative spirit through tools like Stack Overflow for Teams, which revolutionized how our engineers shared knowledge and solved problems, reducing resolution times by a remarkable 30%. Our journey included transitioning pilot teams to utilize modern CI/CD tools like Helm charts and GitHub Actions, cutting down cycle times dramatically and setting new standards for efficiency.

PMO Process Initiative:
As a voice of leadership within the PMO, I championed the establishment of a TPM practices committee that crystallized roles, streamlined processes, and fostered unprecedented levels of collaboration across the teams. This was not just about process improvement; it was about building a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, ensuring everyone from product management to software engineering was aligned and empowered.

Through each of these roles at Rally Health, I not only faced and overcame immense challenges but also crafted pathways for others to follow, embedding resilience and innovation at the core of our operations. Like the protagonist in a complex system's narrative, each initiative I led was a thread in the larger fabric of our organizational transformation, driven by the relentless pursuit of excellence and the profound commitment to our community's health.
