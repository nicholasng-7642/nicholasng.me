      <description>Moved to Denmark, joined an European Unicorn ðŸ¦„ After relocating from Amsterdam to Copenhagen - I joined SumUp to work in the danish headquarters as an Engineering Manager for the Accounting Squad, in the Merchant Growth Tribe. The team I joined had been part of a previous acquisition of SumUp (Debitoor): merging cultures and integrating into the overall company was a big challenge.&#xA;At SumUp I got hands-on with a more complex organizational setup and map, with a tribalized setup; and highly enjoyed the reflective spirit of the company when finding new ways of working.</description>
